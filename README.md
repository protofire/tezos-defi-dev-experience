# Become a Tezos developer

This is the code for a series of [tutorias]() where we will explain how to create, deploy and interact with a smart contract written in LIGO for Tezos.

The structure is self-descriptive:
* In the solidy folder you can find the solidity contracts version. v1, related with the basic contract and v3 with the final version.

* In the tezos-ligo folder, you can find the contracts related to each tutorial. Each tutorial will increase the contract features. Each contract will contain two versions, .ligo containing the ligo version and .tz containing the code compiled to Michelson.

## Blog posts
We have written a series of blogpost that will guide you into getting started with tezos.
